        <h2>Chapter 3: Application Software</h2>
    </div>
    
    <!--Content/ Individual Points of the Topic-->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>A <b>computer</b> is a piece of electronic equipment. Because it is powered by electricity, it is referred to as an electronic device. It accepts data, processes it, and outputs the appropriate results. The output of a computer system is also known as the result of the computer system.</p>
        <p>A programmed set of instructions used to perform a given task is referred to as <b>software</b>. The hardware runs all of the software. The two main categories of software are <b>system software</b> and <b>application software</b>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Application Software</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>The term “application software” refers to software that performs specific functions for a user. When a user interacts directly with a piece of software, it is called application software. The sole purpose of application software is to assist the user in doing specified tasks.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>You can control and interact with a program using a <b>user interface</b>.</p>
        <p>A graphical user interface (GUI) is a digital interface in which a user interacts with graphical components such as icons, buttons, and menus. In a GUI, the visuals displayed in the user interface convey information relevant to the user, as well as actions that they can take.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Character User Interface</h2>

            </figure>
            <div>
                <p>Before graphical user interfaces, users interacted with computers using character user interfaces, or CUIs. In a CUI, users type text commands on their keyboard to execute actions on the device.</p>
                <p>While useful for programmers, CUIs were only really accessible to IT professionals and advanced users. The interface was confusing to novices, as well as inefficient since commands had to be memorized and typed correctly each time — not something that would appeal to a mass market.</p>

            <p>A few years later, Apple released its first GUI operating system, Macintosh, in 1984. Microsoft debuted its first GUI the following year in Windows 1.0. These two groundbreaking operating systems introduced icons to represent things like files, folders, applications, and buttons.</p>

    <h2>How GUI Works</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>In a GUI, visual elements represent actions users can take, objects that users can manipulate, and other information relevant to the user.</p>
        <p>Some common visual elements are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The mouse cursor, which moves and manipulates other elements</li>
            <li>Buttons, which users may click or tap to initiate an action</li>
            <li>Toolbar and ribbons, essentially groups of buttons</li>
            <li>Icons, small images that represent information or interactive components</li>
            <li>Menus, lists of clickable items</li>
            <li>Scrollbars, for scrolling down the page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes, GUI graphics are tied to real-world objects to represent their purpose and help users understand the functions available to them.</p>
        <p>When the user initiates an interaction, the GUI typically responds with some signal like a color or size change in the clicked element, a sound, or another effect, and then the system carries out the requested action.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>General Purpose Application</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>A general purpose application, sometimes known as <b>‘off-the-shelf’</b> is the sort of software that you use at home and school.  Examples include word processors, spreadsheets, databases, desktop publishing packages, graphics packages etc.</p>
        <p>This type of software tries to be a <b>‘jack-of-all-trades’</b>.  It provides many features that the majority of users will want e.g. formatting text, creating charts, organizing tables</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Specialized Application</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p><b>Specialized applications</b> are widely used within specific professions. They include graphics programs, video game design software.</p>
        <p>These are softwares that are specially designed for an individual or company’s specific needs.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Mobile Application</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Are add-on programs for a variety of mobile devices. Traditional applications include address book, to-do list, alarms, and message lists. Recently, mobile capabilities have exploded.</p>
