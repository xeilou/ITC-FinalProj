    </div>

    <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>A <b>computer</b> is an electronic device that manipulates information or data. it has the ability to <b>store</b>, <b>retrieve</b>, and <b>process</b> data.</p>
        <p>You may already know that you can use a computer to <b>type</b>, <b>send email</b>, <b>play games</b>, and <b>browse the web</b>. You can also use it to edit or create <b>spreadsheets</b>, <b>presentations</b>, and even <b>videos</b>.</p>
        <p>But, have you ever wondered how this wonderful device in front of you came to be the way that it is today?</p>

    <h2>Early Computing devices</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>People used sticks, stones, and bones as counting tools before computers were invented. More computing devices were produced as technology advanced and the human intellect improved over time. Let us look at a few of the early-age computing devices used by mankind.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Abacus (2700 - 2300 BCE)</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="inLine">

            </figure>
            <p>Abacus was invented by the Chinese around 4000 years ago. It’s a wooden rack with metal rods with beads attached to them. The abacus operator moves the beads according to certain guidelines to complete arithmetic computations.</p>

    <h2>Napier's Bones (1617)</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="inLine">
            <figure>
                <img src="Images/chap2-img2-NapiersBones.jpg" alt="Image of a Napier's Bones">

            </figure>
            <p>John Napier devised Napier’s Bones, a manually operated calculating apparatus. For calculating, this instrument used 9 separate ivory strips (bones) marked with numerals to multiply and divide. It was also the first machine to calculate using the decimal point system.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Pascaline (1642)</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="inLine">
            <figure>
                <img src="Images/chap2-img3-Pascaline.jpg" alt="Image of a Pascaline">

            </figure>
            <p>Pascaline was invented in 1642 by Biaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher. It is thought to be the first mechanical and automated calculator. It was a wooden box with gears and wheels inside.</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Stepped Reckoner (1673)</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="inLine">

            </figure>
            <p>In 1673, a German mathematician-philosopher named Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved on Pascal’s invention to create this apparatus. It was a digital mechanical calculator known as the stepped reckoner because it used fluted drums instead of gears.</p>

    <h2>Analytical Engine (1830)</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="inLine">

            </figure>
            <p>Charles Babbage, the father of computers, created a calculating machine, the Analytical Engine, in 1830. It was a mechanical computer that took input from punch cards. It was capable of solving any mathematical problem and storing data in an indefinite memory.</p>

    <h2>Tabulating Machine (1890)</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="inLine">

            </figure>
            <p>An American Statistician – Herman Hollerith invented this machine in the year 1890. Tabulating Machine was a punch card-based mechanical tabulator. It could compute statistics and record or sort data or information. Hollerith began manufacturing these machines in his company, which ultimately became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Howard Aiken planned to build a machine in 1937 that could conduct massive calculations or calculations using enormous numbers. The Mark I computer was constructed in 1944 as a collaboration between IBM and Harvard.</p>

    <h2>Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (1946)</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>Then more than a century later in the history of computers, we got our first electronic computer for general purpose. It was the ENIAC, which stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. The inventors of this computer were John W. Mauchly and J.Presper Eckert.</p>

                </figure>
            <p>With times the technology developed and the computers got smaller and the processing got faster. We got our first laptop in 1981 and it was introduced by Adam Osborne and EPSON.</>
